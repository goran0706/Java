**Q:**  What's a "member" of a class or an object?

**A:**  A member is any piece of state or behavior that belongs to the class or object.  In general, a member refers to any field, method, or constructor in a class.  However, sometimes the term "class member" is used to specifically refer to static methods and static variables.


**Q:**  What's the difference between a "default" and a "no-arg" constructor?

**A:**  A "no-arg" constructor is one that lists no parameters (it takes no arguments).  A "default" constructor is a "no-arg" constructor that is created by the compiler, in the event that you don't explicitly create one yourself.
