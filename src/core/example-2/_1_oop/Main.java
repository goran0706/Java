/*
 * Object-oriented Programming (OOP):
 * - Focus is on objects, which have behaviors and data
 * - Classes are used as blueprints to create objects
 *
 * Objects:
 * - An object represents an entity that has both behaviors and data
 * - This forms encapsulation
 *
 * There are three primary principles of OOP:
 * - Encapsulation
 * - Inheritance
 * - Polymorphism
 *
 * Encapsulation:
 * Classes have private fields and public methods to access the fields
 * -- Data cannot be unexpectedly modified from outside the class
 * -- Option to validate before modifying
 * -- Class is in control of its own data, and functionality to change or get data has to be implemented in one place only.
 *
 * Inheritance:
 * A class can get properties and methods from a parent class.
 * - Classes can inherit from a parent class. They can only have one direct parent
 * - The child class inherits all fields and methods from the parent class that are visible (access modifiers) inside the child class
 * -- Avoid duplicate code
 * -- Better structure and better maintainability
 * -- Option to bundle different classes as the same kind
 *
 * Polymorphism:
 * You can refer to a class by its parent.
 * Referring to a class not with the class type exactly, but with another type that also represents the class.
