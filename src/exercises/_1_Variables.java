         * Summary:
         *
         * 1) A variable is a name that allocates a chuck of memory that can hold some sort of data.
         * 2) The type of the value the variable can hold is determined by the variables data type.
         * 3) The variable name that we come up with is called an "identifier".
         * 4) When we write a variable followed by the variable name that is called a "variable declaration".
         * 5) When we have a variable name then the equal assignment operator and a value that is called a "variable initialization".
         *
         * Terminology:
         * - Variable
         * - Data type
         * - Identifier
         * - Declaration
         * - Assignment
         * - Initialization
